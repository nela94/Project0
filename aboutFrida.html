        <h1>About Frida</h1>
        <p>Frida Khalo was an artist who to this day inspires many women to take chances and live a full life regardless of their situation. She defied social norms of what a woman should be,
          especially in the era she was born. She lived through a horrific accident that left her disabled and in pain for most of her life. She took the time that she was bedreddin to paint paintings
          that dipicted her pain. Through her art, she caught the attention of Diego Rivera, a famous painter, who in her words was one of the worse things that could happen to her. They were married but
          Diego would cheat on her with other women. These actions made Frida feel lonley and depressed. She showed most of her pain through her paintings and that was her only escape from her realty. Frida lived
          in the shadows of Diego. People did not appreciate her work until she was gone. Below is a table of Frida's paintings and there worth now.
